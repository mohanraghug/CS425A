## Running the codes

## Question 1

The solution file Q1.py is available in the Q1 directory of  this zip folder

```
python Q1.py
```

## Question 2

**Sender**

As described in the question, the functions makePack, sendMessage, acc_Acks & resend have been implemented.*

The solution file sender.py is available in the Q2/sen directory of this zip folder.
```
python sender.py
```

\* : The management of variables and function calls might vary based on our interpretation and ease of implmentation.

Note: Please try and run again if you encountered a port occupied /connection refused
error. The error is probably due the receiver thread attempting to connecting before
the sender is ready or a port already in use.
